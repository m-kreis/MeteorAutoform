# MeteorAutoform

This repository is used to demonstrate a problem with the aldeed:autoform package when using autosaveOnKeyup on a form.

Steps to reproduce:
1. clone this repository
2. meteor npm install --save simpl-schema
3. meteor run
4. add a person
5. edit person

As you can see the input field looses focus while typing.
